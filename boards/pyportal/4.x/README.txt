Welcome to PYPORTAL

PyPortal, is our design for easy-to-use IoT device design. It has
everything you need built in to create internet-connected devices
in minutes. Make custom touch screen interface GUIs, all open-source, 
and Python-powered using tinyJSON / APIs to get news, stock, weather, 
cat photos, and more! All over secure Wi-Fi with the latest technologies. 
Create little pocket universes of joy that connect to something good.

The PyPortal comes loaded with an Adafruit Quotes demo. You may have
already seen the lovely inspirational quotes on your Adafruit invoices.
(In fact, we call them 'innovoices' - Innovation through Invoices - but
that's a story for another tim). But did you know that you can get
those quote through an online API? That's right you can visit
      https://www.adafruit.com/api/quotes.php
Right now to get a randomly-selected quote to inspire and amuse you.
We can turn this simple service into its own stand-alone devices using
the PyPortal.

*** You must first tell the PyPortal your WiFi SSID and Password. ***
This is set in the 'secrets.py' file on the CIRCUITPY drive. Open it
with any text editor and change the 'ssid' and 'password' values from
CHANGE ME to whatever is your access point and password.

On start up, we display a welcome.bmp image file and play a welcome.wav
file. Delete or rename the welcome.wav and welcome.bmp files to stop them
from playing/displaying on bootup

We have more projects, demos and information about the Pyportal
